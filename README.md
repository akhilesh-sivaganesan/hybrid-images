# Hybrid Images

This project aims to blend two images to show one image up close, and the other image from a distance. When the low frequency components of an image are used, they are visible easily up close. However from a distance, higher frequency components are more visible. Based on a tunable threshold, we can optimize the salience of near and far images.
